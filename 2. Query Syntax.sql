1. ALL | DISTINCT
	* ALL includes all values in the result set. [Default]
	* DISTINCT eliminates duplicate values from the result set.
	
2. TOP <n>
	Specifies the maximum number of results to return.
	
3. <object_name> or <alias>
	Specifies the object identifier or object alias (column name) as defined in the FROM clause.
	
4. ILIKE '<pattern>'
	Specifies that only the columns that match <pattern> should be included in the results.
	In <pattern>, you can use the following SQL wildcards:
		* Use an underscore (_) to match any single character.
		* Use a percent sign (%) to match any sequence of zero or more characters.
		
5. EXCLUDE <col_name> or EXCLUDE (<col_name>, <col_name>, ...)
	Specifies the columns that should be excluded from the results.
		
6. REPLACE (<expr> AS <col_name> [ , <expr> AS <col_name>, ...] )
	
7. RENAME <col_name> AS <col_alias> or RENAME (<col_name> AS <col_alias>, <col_name> AS <col_alias>, ...)
	
Note:
	When specifying a combination of keywords after SELECT *:
	You cannot specify both ILIKE and EXCLUDE.
	If you specify EXCLUDE with RENAME or REPLACE:
		You must specify EXCLUDE before RENAME or REPLACE
		You cannot specify the same column in EXCLUDE and RENAME
	If you specify ILIKE with RENAME or REPLACE, you must specify ILIKE first
	If you specify REPLACE and RENAME:
		You must specify REPLACE first
	You can specify the same column name in REPLACE and RENAME

8. $<col_position>
	Specifies the position of the column (1-based) as defined in the FROM clause.

# Attention: 
	When using a recursive CTE, it is possible to create a query that goes into an infinite loop and consumes credits until the query succeeds, the query times out (e.g. exceeds the number of seconds specified by the STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_IN_SECONDS parameter), or you cancel the query.
	
2.1 Anchor clause
	The anchor clause in a recursive CTE is a SELECT statement.
	The anchor clause is executed once during the execution of the statement in which it is embedded; it runs before the recursive clause and generates the first set of rows from the recursive CTE. These rows are not only included in the output of the query, but also referenced by the recursive clause.
	
2.2 Recursive clause
	The recursive clause is a SELECT statement. This SELECT is restricted to projections, filters, and joins (inner joins and outer joins in which the recursive reference is on the preserved side of the outer join). The recursive clause cannot contain:
		* Aggregate or window functions,
		* GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT, or DISTINCT.
	The recursive clause usually includes a JOIN that joins the table that was used in the anchor clause to the CTE. However, the JOIN can join more than one table or table-like data source (view, etc.).
	The first iteration of the recursive clause starts with the data from the anchor clause. That data is then joined to the other table(s) in the FROM clause of the recursive clause.

Rotates a table by turning the unique values from one column in the input expression into multiple columns and aggregating results where required on any remaining column values. In a query, it is specified in the FROM clause after the table name or subquery.
